For NWEA Eligibility (required rit score at grade level):
"IF(L2=""N/A"",""No"",
  IF(G2=5,IF(L2>=204,""Yes"",""No""),
  IF(G2=6,IF(L2>=210,""Yes"",""No""),

To find ICA Distance to Met:
"if(P2=""N/A"",""N/A"",if(isblank(P2),"""",
switch(G2,9,P2-2567,
10,P2-2571,
11,P2-2577,
12,P2-2583)
))"

Here is a basic summary of the structure:

Info Sheet - I started a documentation sheet and listed a couple formulas I used but it's not really complete.
Student List Sheet - This is the main sheet that lists all current english learner students and calculates their eligibility for reclassification. It starts with columns A-J that are filed from an export from our PowerSchool Student Information System (PS).

The remaining Sheets are all data sheets with data imported from extracts from the various platforms we spoke about on our call:

WPAData - Is imported from an Illuminate data extract.
CurrentYearGPA - A PowerSchool data extract.
LastEngGrade - A PowerSchool data extract.
18-19 ELPAC Data - An extract from the CA State CAASPP Test Platform.
NWEA Fall20 - A NWEA Assessment Platform data extract.
ICA 20-21 ELA - An extract from the CA State CAASPP Test Platform.
Language Codes - Just a data lookup table to match CA state language codes to names in column I of the student list.
19-20 CalOutreach ELPAC - This is just some supplemental ELPAC data that was provided by state for SOME students during the COVID remote schooling period. It will not be used in future calculations.

Here's basically what's going on in the Student List Sheet:
Col A-J - The student list of english learners populated from PowerSchool student data.
"Col K-S - Lookup of student results for the ELPAC test. Column K, Overall Level, needs to be 4 as the first requirement to be reclassified fluent english proficient (RFEP)."
Col T-X - Lookup of student results from latest NWEA ELA test and check if they meet requirements for RFEP (W).
Col Y-AC - Lookup of CAASPP ICA ELA scores and check if they meet RFEP requirements (AB).
Col AD - AF - Lookup Writing Proficiency Assessment (WPA) scores and check if they meet RFEP requirements (AF).
Col AG - AJ - These are lookups of current school performance metrics (GPA/Grades) that are merged into the attached RFEP form for teacher reference when approving reclassification (see attached rfep form for details).
Col AK - Returns Yes for Reclassification if they are found eligible in cols W or AB or AF.
